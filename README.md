# CareVine: Caregiving Marketplace Platform

CareVine is a web application that served as a platform for a caregiving marketplace. It's built on
top of the Sharetribe Flex Template for Web (FTW-hourly) and includes extensive customizations for
caregiving services. The project was shut down in November 2023, but a demo version is available at:
[https://carevine.onrender.com/](https://carevine.onrender.com/)

**Note:** The demo version is not fully functional and is missing many features. It is not intended
for production use.

## Project Overview

CareVine connects caregivers with those seeking care services. Key features include:

- User profiles for caregivers and care seekers
- Booking system for care services
- Review and rating system
- Payment processing
- Search and filtering options
- Background check system for caregivers

## Demo

A demo version is available at: [https://carevine.onrender.com/](https://carevine.onrender.com/)

## Technology Stack

- React.js
- Node.js
- Express
- Sass for styling

## Local Setup

Local setup is complex due to the Sharetribe Flex platform requirements. It needs various API keys,
environment variables, and understanding of the Sharetribe Flex ecosystem. Since the project is shut
down, we just recommend using the demo version.
